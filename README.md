## :dart: Project Objective:
The project is based on food apps (iFood, UberEats and Rappi) and is designed as mobile first. Our project was developed based on the layout made by the designer Camila Mizutani (in which the UberEats app was used as reference). Since this is the last project of the frontend module of Labenu's web development bootcamp, the main goal is to apply all the knowledge acquired during the last 3 months in a complex and complete project, fully functional.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Layout:
The layout was developed by designer Camila Mizutani and can be accessed [by clicking here].(https://scene.zeplin.io/project/5dcc566ddc1332bf7fb4f450)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features:
   - Login: logs the user in and stores the user's authentication information in local storage.
   - Sign Up: performs a new user registration and redirects to the address registration screen.
   - Address registration: performs the user registration and redirects to the Home screen.
   - Home: renders all restaurants, has a filter by category and redirects to the search page when clicking on the search input.
   - Search: Searches restaurants by name.
   - Home and Search: by clicking on the cards on this screen the user is redirected to the selected restaurant's page.
   - Restaurants: render the restaurant and its product information, when clicking add it opens a popup to inform the quantity and when confirming the item is added to the cart, it is also possible to remove this item, it is not possible to add items from different restaurants.
   - Cart: the user can remove items, make the purchase, if there is a purchase in progress you can only make another one when it is completed.
   - The only public pages are Login and Registration, the others can only be accessed by logged in users.
